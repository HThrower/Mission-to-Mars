# Mission-to-Mars
 As part of the assignment of creating a web app that displays information about Mars’s hemispheres online.
 The process of doing this requires the use of BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images
 of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database,
 use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
 
 # Resources
 * Software/Libraries: Visual Studio Code 1.56.0, jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Jupyter lab 3.0.14, Flask 1.1.2,
   Splinter 1.26.4, Web Drive Manager, Beautiful Soup, Pymongo, MongoDB 4.4.6, Mongo DB Compass, htmlslib, lxml.
 * Code Files: Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb, Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.py, Mission_to_Mars.ipynb 
 
 # Results:
 The final product was created using Flask to obtain images, a table with information about Mars in comparison to Earth, and the latest article title finializing a fully-functional web application. When the "Scrape New Data" button is pressed this will allow for new information to update both the website and the MongoDB.
