# Mission-to-Mars
 As part of the assignment of creating a web app that displays information about Mars’s hemispheres online.
 The process of doing this requires the use of BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images
 of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database,
 use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

one of the draws backs where it take a while for the page to reload once you press the scrape new data buttom and with additional time bootstraping i believe that this issue coud be easily resovled. I would suggest addition visual adds to be added to the web page like the 4 phases of mars and potential looking at different font/color to make it easier on the reader.
